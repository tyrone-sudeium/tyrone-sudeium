### Hi, I'm Tyrone. 👋

I'm a seasoned software developer, Objective-C traditionalist, Free Desktop user, and free software advocate. I’ve been doing iOS development professionally since 2008, and work as a Lead Engineer for the cross-platform iOS + Android + Web frontend at a leading online “E-commerce” business based in Australia.

In my spare time I like to play with:

- Native macOS
- React Native
- TypeScript, Node.js
- RPG Maker / [EasyRPG](https://github.com/easyrpg)
- Rust
- Final Fantasy XIV
